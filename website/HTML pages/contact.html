                            Dear UC Berkeley Community,
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Beginning your Cal career is anything but easy; whether you are moving to Berkeley from your hometown only 30 minutes away or from across the world, the sudden change in atmosphere and community can be difficult to navigate. 
                            The taxing transition to Cal is one that we identified as a focus for our ASUC office over the summer, and we have been working diligently to provide this platform for all Cal students to explore the resources and services available to them.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The goal of this website is to provide a “one stop shop” of all the different categories of resources and how to access the services themselves. 
                            This way, students know what is available to them before they even need a resource. 
                            However, the information is organized in a manner that it is easy for anyone to find a resource related to a specific need.
                            <br>
                            <br>                            
                            We recognize that this website is a continuously developing project and plan to update it regularly with the most current information and new resources that we become aware of. 
                            If you are unable to find information that you think should be more readily available to students, if you are aware of any services not included in this website, or if you are a part of an organization that provides services to students that should be included on this website, please fill out the “Information Request” Google Form linked in the “Contact Us” section of the website. 
                            For any other questions, comments, or concerns, please contact us at iromo@asuc.org.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Lastly, I would like to thank the Transition to Cal department in my senate office for all of their work in creating this website, and all of the commissions who provided us with information for the website. 
                            This could not have been done without the collective effort and passion for the project.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In community,
                            <br>
                            Issabella Romo
                            <br>
