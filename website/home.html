                            When accessing academic resources there are a variety of options available. 
                            The Career Center helps students navigate their career as an undergraduate. 
                            They also help students choosing majors and exploring different career options to find internships. 
                            Whether itâ€™s helping students look for part time/full time employment or preparing for graduate school. 
                            Another resource available is the Student Learning Center, also known as SLC. 
                            The SLC is a community of 8000 under-graduates, over 250 tutors and instructors, and 20 professional staff. 
                            Their overall goal is to help students with course load and promote academic excellence and personal success. 
                            The Academic Resources In Residence Halls is also a resource to help students with classes. 
                            Academic Services in the Residence Halls provides the academic support services and resources necessary for residential students to transition successfully into academic life at Cal.
                            An Academic Services Center is available in each unit. 
                            These services and resources include academic advising, tutoring, faculty-interaction programs, study-space, residential theme programs, and technology services.

                            If you are a Berkeley student who receives financial aid and has a Federal Work-Study award, you can browse for on-campus work study employment through your student portal. 
                            You can use the career center to help you create resumes and cover letters for work study positions. 
                            Students are also able to access Student Legal Services. 
                            Their goal is to refer and guide students who are considering legal action, but they do not provide representation. 
                            Berkeley Students are also able to access the ASUC - Legal Clinic. 
                            Their mission is to provide free and confidential legal research tailored to clients' specific issues. 
                            Clients can drop in or make an appointment to address their legal concerns. 
                            The Clinic also participates in the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program, which provides free tax preparation services to qualified students and community members.
